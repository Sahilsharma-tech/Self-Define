🟢 1. What does #include <iostream> mean?
It is basically telling the computer, “I want to use stuff that lets me print things or take input”
iostream is a built-in C++ library that gives you access to cout (for output) and cin (for input).
cout can be pronounced as "see-out".
cin can be procounced as "see-in".

🟢 2. Why do we write using namespace std;?
C++ keeps most of its features inside something called the “std” namespace.
Writing this line saves you from typing std::cout every time and you can just write cout.

🟢 3. What does void mean before the function name?
void simply means the function doesn’t give anything back.
It does its job (printing “Hello World”) and that is it, no return value.

🟢 4. What is a function in C++?
A function is just a reusable block of code that does one specific thing.
Here, function() is a helper that prints your message whenever you call it.

🟢 5. Why do we call the function inside main()?
Because that’s where the program starts running.
If you don’t call the function from main(), it just sits there and never runs.

🟢 6. What does return 0; do?
It tells the computer, “Everything ran fine and no errors occured”
If the program had issues, it might return another number instead.

🟢 7. Why do we use cout to print text?
cout stands for “console output”
It is the way you tell your program to show something on the screen.

🟢 8. Can I print “Hello World” without using a function?
Yes, You can write ->
cout << "Hello World"; 
inside main().
But using a function makes your code neater and clean, especially when your program gets bigger.

🟢 9. Can a function return something instead of void?
Yes, If you want your function to give back a message instead of just printing it, you can do this:
string function() {
    return "Hello World";
}
Then inside main():
cout << function();
That is how you make a function return something.

🟢 10. What if I forget using namespace std;?
Then you will have to write:
std::cout << "Hello World";
It is just a bit longer, not wrong.
That is why many beginners add using namespace std; at the top.

🟢 11. Can I change the function name?
Yes, You can name it anything like Hello() or PrintHello().
Just make sure you call it with the same name inside main().
