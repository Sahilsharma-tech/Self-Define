ğŸ”¹ WHAT ARE CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS?
-----------------------------------
Conditional statements are used to make decisions in a program.
They let your code do something only if a certain condition is true.
For example ->
if you are older than 18, you can vote.
Otherwise, you cant.

ğŸ”¹ IF STATEMENT
-----------------------------------
It runs a block of code only if the condition is true.
Example ->
int marks = 18;
if (marks >= 18) {
    cout << "You passed";
}
Output:
You passed 
(If marks were less than 18, nothing would print.)

ğŸ”¹ IF ELSE STATEMENT
Used when you want one thing to happen if the condition is true and something else to happen if its false.
Example ->
int marks = 40;
if (marks >= 50) {
    cout << "You passed!";
} else {
    cout << "You failed!";
}
Output:
You failed!

ğŸ”¹ ELSE IF LADDER
Used when there are multiple conditions to check, one after another.
Example -> 
int marks = 85;
if (marks >= 90) {
    cout << "Grade A";
} else if (marks >= 75) {
    cout << "Grade B";
} else if (marks >= 50) {
    cout << "Grade C";
} else {
    cout << "Fail";
}
Output:
Grade B
