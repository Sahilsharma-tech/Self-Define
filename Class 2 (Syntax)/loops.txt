ðŸ”¹ WHAT ARE LOOPS?
-----------------------------------
Loops are used when you want to run a block of code multiple time without having to write it again and again.
Example ->
If you want to print Hello 5 times, instead of:
cout << "Hello";
cout << "Hello";
cout << "Hello";
cout << "Hello";
cout << "Hello";
You can just use a loop.


ðŸ”¹ FOR LOOP
-----------------------------------
Used when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.

Syntax:
for (initialization; condition; updation) { // Remember using I C U
    // code to repeat
}

Example:
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    cout << "Hello" << endl;
}
Output:
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello

Explanation:
int i = 1; â†’ starting point
i <= 5; â†’ condition checked each time
i++ â†’ increases i by 1 after every loop


ðŸ”¹ WHILE LOOP
-----------------------------------
Used when you dont know before running the code that how many times you will loop.
It keeps running as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // code to repeat
}
Example:
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    cout << i << endl;
    i++;
}
Output:
1
2
3
4
5


ðŸ”¹ DO WHILE LOOP
-----------------------------------
This is similar to the while loop but the main difference is that the code runs at least once even if the condition is false.

Syntax:
do {
    // code to repeat
} while (condition);
Example:
int i = 6;
do {
    cout << i << endl;
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
Output:
6

Explanation:
Even though the condition (i <= 5) is false from the start the code still runs once before checking it.
